# BlackJack-Java
This is a simple implementation of BlackJack using Java GUI to create an okay looking game, whilst following object oriented conventions and documenting the code. 
https://danieldimanov.github.io/BlackJack-Java/
The repository has the following structure:

1. The directory BlackJack Java App/ contains the actual Java implementation.
2. The docs/ directory contains the JavaDocs for the application, which can be found on https://danieldimanov.github.io/BlackJack-Java/ as well.
3. The pdf document BJ Classes contains the class diagrams for the application.
4. MockUps_Screen_Design.pdf contains the mockup design.
5. The TestPlan is the test plan for the application. 

You can download the app and run it by cloning the project and running it with any java compiler. 
Images used in the project could not be provided, but you can use your own images. Make sure you name them using the following convention:
Starting with:
"S" for Spades
"C" for Clubs
"H" for Hearts and
"D" for Diamonds
Then:
1-13 for the card number (1 is Ace, 11 is Jack, 12 is Queen and 13 is King)
All images should be png files.
So example is the image for the king of spades would be "S13.png".

Screenshots may be seen in the test plan.
